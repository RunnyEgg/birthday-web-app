# Birthday Gifts Website

## Overview
This website is created to showcase the birthday gifts for my dad since the physical gifts did not arrive on time. The website is accessed via a QR code, which links to an HTML page with details and images of the gifts.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Elements:** Includes buttons that reveal the gifts when clicked, accompanied by a confetti effect to enhance the celebratory experience.
- **Gift Previews:** Images and descriptions of the gifts are initially hidden and are displayed when the corresponding button is clicked.

## Instructions
1. **Accessing the Website:**
   - Scan the QR code provided with the gift. This will direct you to the birthday gifts website.

2. **Viewing the Gifts:**
   - Upon opening the website, you will be greeted with a birthday message.
   - Click the button labeled "Click here to see your first gift!" to reveal the first gift.
   - After clicking the first button, an image of the first gift will be displayed along with a message. A second button will also appear.
   - Click the second button labeled "But wait, that's not all! Click to see your second gift!" to reveal the second gift.
